# First Milestone Project
***
## Phat Poly Handmade Jewellery Website
***
### Site Description
The idea was to create a website to display jewellery. The site would be divided amongst 4 pages; a home page and 3 
product pages to display the 3 differnt types of jewellery (studs, dangles and necklaces). The site itself uses bright
pastel colours to keep in theme with the colourful jewellery. This site will also function as a shop where customers 
can purchase the products.


### UX
A prototype layout was constructed using Adobe xD software. Displayed below is the
first prototype for the layout without the final colours.

The final website design used Bootstrap in the nav bar in order to simplify 
the layout on a mobile device by collapsing the navigation menu and in the footer
to change the display depending on the screen size.

The font used in the main logo 'Phat Poly' called 'Chewy' was imported from Google
fonts.

The home page of the final website front end build is displayed below. All pictures
and design was done by me.

## Technologies used
This front end project was built using HTML5 and CSS within Gitpod.
Most of the code research was done using [w3schools.com](www.w3schools.com).

Bootstrap [(bootstrap)](www.getbootstrap.com) was used to control the collapsing
navbar as well as in the footer to control the layout when displayed on a mobile
device. Bootstrap was also used to control the widths of the display columns that
held the products.
